// Walk for package.json rather than parsing pnpm-workspace globs: the globs vary
// per repo (apps/*, packages/*, tools/*, or a single root package) and getting
// that resolution subtly wrong would skip a package silently.
// A root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` used to be a reliable "this is a monorepo root, and
// therefore not itself publishable" marker. Since pnpm 10 the same file also carries
// settings — `allowBuilds`, `onlyBuiltDependencies`, catalogs — so single-package repos
// have one too, with no `packages:` key in it at all. Treating its mere presence as
// "skip the root" made the gate find zero packages and exit clean: assertron, unpartial
// and satisfier all gated nothing while reporting success.
//
// Deliberately not a YAML parse. This script ships with no dependencies, and a
// top-level `packages:` key is unambiguous at column 0.
